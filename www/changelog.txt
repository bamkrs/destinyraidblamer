=== a0.9 ===
* Compare two players of a raid! Just hit one "Compare With"-Button on the bottom of a player statistic. Check it out! (Will be expanded with functionalities over time!)
* Implemented a hidden dark theme for the raid-/blameview: Just add ?dark at the end of the URL!
* Cleaned the code a bit.

=== a0.8.4 ===
* Hardened the Code. XSS, invalid Guardiannames and Raid-ID's will (for) now result in a execution halt.
* Fixed a bug when a player was in one raid with multiple characters it was only possible to check one of his characters. (With the drawback of an ugly URL for 2Charactes1Player)
* When hovering the raid-panels in the raid overview the pointer will now change to a hand. (Thanks FRETER_PAN for this hint!) 

=== a0.8.3 ===
* Fixed King's Fall hard mode wasn't displayed as hard mode
* Fixed errors that appeared in player view with no kills

=== a0.8.2 ===
* First release with tracked changes ;)
* Changed the black shadow to yellow/gold for hard mode raids
* Added an About-Page
* Open Alpha Release
